"We may think of each lexical entry as incorporating a set of transformations that insert the item in question (that is, the complex of features that constitutes it) in phrase-markers. Thus (2) a lexical transformation associated with the lexical item I maps a phrasemarker P containing a substructure Q into a phrase-marker P' formed by replacing Q by I."

..but: all lexical transformation happen before all non-lexical transformations...

"cause to die": p. 189
"The relation could not be identity, however. As has often been remarked, 'causative'
verbs such as 'kill', 'raise', 'bum' (as in 'John burned the toast'), etc., differ in meaning from
the associated phrases 'cause to die', 'cause to rise', 'cause to burn', etc., in that they imply a directness of connection between the agent and the resulting event that is lacking in the latter case. Thus John's negligence can cause the toast to bum, but it cannot bum the toast. Similarly, I can cause someone to die by arranging for him to drive cross-country with a pattitological murderer, but I could not properly be said to have killed him, in this case. The point is discussed in Hall (1965)." 

p. 201
"According to this conception, the focus of (45 a) can be taken as any of the
phrases (51), and the corresponding presupposition is expressed by replacement of
the focus by a variable:
(51) (i) an ex-convict with a red shirt
(ii) with a red shirt
(iii) a red shirt
(iv) shirt.
All of the phrases of (51) contain the intonation center in (45 a); hence each, in this conception, can be taken as focus."


p. 205 parallelism
"The processes involved in determining contrastive or expressive intonation at the
moment do not appear to be germane to this discussion. However, it is worth noting
that they cannot be described, at least in any natural way, in terms of deep structure.
This becomes most obvious when we consider positions in which there must be a
contrastive intonation. Thus consider the sentence (72):
(72) John is neither EASY to please, nor EAGER to please, nor CERTAIN to please,
nor INCLINED to please, nor HAPPY to please, ...
In 'parallel constructions', in some sense of this notion that has never been made
quite clear, contrastive intonation is necessary. But it is evident, in such examples as
(72) at least, that it is a parallelism of surface structure, not deep structure, that is
involved. The point is even clearer when we consider such sentences as (73):
(73) John is more concerned with AFfirmation than with CONfirmation.
Here, the parallelism requires even a shift in contour within a single word. There are
many similar cases."


Page 204/205: added emphasis can make focus projection harder:
"In this case, as distinct from the case of normal intonation (64i), the natpral
response is (65 ii), not (65 i). On the other hand, the sentence' No, he kept it' setms
much less natural as a response to (71) than to either case of (64). This observation
(and its analogue in other cases) suggests that when expressive or contrastive stress
shifts intonation center, the same principle applies as in normal cases for detetermining
focus and presupposition, but with the additional proviso that naturalness declines
far more sharply as larger and larger phrases containing the intonation center! are
considered as a possible focus. This would be a very natural interpretation of contrastive
or expressive intonation, and it seems consistent with a number of relatively
clear cases, at least. Hence it may perhaps be proposed as a first approximation to a
general interpretive theory for this phenomenon. The same seems to me to be true
when extra-emphasis is given to the item that contains the normal intonation center."

p. 205 focus and presupposition
"In many cases, it seems that we can interpret a sentence in these terms, given the
intonation center, in the following way. The focus is a phrase containing the intonation
center; the presupposition, an expression derived by replacing the focus by a
variable. Each sentence, then, is associated with a class of pairs (F, P) where F is a
focus and P a presupposition, each such pair corresponding to one possible interpretation. 
In terms of these notions we can begin to explicate such notions as proper
(presupposition-sharing) response. Thus for a sentence 8 interpreted as (F, P) to be
a proper response to a sentence 8' interpreted as (F', Pi), it must be the case that
P = P'. Furthermore, F and F' must be paired in some' natural' way, where the
relevant concept of' naturalness' no doubt extends beyond grammar, in the broadest
sense of the concept' grammar'."

p. 206 Bierwisch's point: focus has to have a meaning (focus and idioms etc.)
"more generally, items that make a contribution to the meaning of a sentence that is in some
sense independent of anything outside the focus. In particular, then, the syllable containing
the intonation center cannot serve as focus when it is part of a larger lexical item (except under
the rather different circumstances of contrastive stress, as illustrated by (73). Similarly, in a
sentence such as 'Did you call him UP', the item' up' cannot serve as focus, but only' call him
up' or the full proposition, and in 'Did you take it for GRANTED', neither' granted' nor' for
granted', but only' take it for granted' (or the full proposition) can be taken as focus. This is
an obvious condition to be placed on the notion of' focus', given the role it plays in explaining
how sentences arc used and interpreted. The same can be said of idioms in general. Hence
determination of focus must involve reference to the lexicon (and, no doubt, an associated
idiom list). This seems to pose no special problem. There are, incidentally, many questions
that can be raised about exactly how an idiom list should be related to a grammar, but these,
so far as I can see, have no bearing on the topic under discussion; nor is there, for the moment,
any interesting suggestion about this matter, to my knowledge. I am grateful to M. Bierwisch
for bringing these facts to my attention."

``for instance in a rightnode-
raising construction or in a selective focus, as in (6e); see Vallduv{\'\i} and Vilkuna
(1998)''

Zimmermann (2008). on corrective focus?

``But first compare the results of Anima for Parisian French in Table 1. When the
patient was narrowly focused, the word order was always canonical (SVO), but in the
case of agent focus, an identificational cleft was obtained in 11 of 14 cases; see the
example in (15a).''

``Hamlaoui (2009a, 2009b) analyzes Francilian French in the same way as proposed
by Samek-Lodovici (2005) for Italian in requiring prominence for focus and in aligning
the accent with the right edge of an -phrase. She proposes that a cleft construction
is the best way to fulfill these requirements in French, given that syntax does not allow
movement of a subject to the right. This effect is achieved by the constraint SUBJECT
from Hamlaoui (2009a, 2009b), reproduced in (16), which requires that subjects be
obligatorily realized, and that they appear in the sentence-initial position.''

``However, and in contrast
to the Germanic languages, post-focal compression is only possible at the level of a
prosodic phrase (-phrase), and not at the level of a prosodic word, which can explain
why French prefers to insert the given material in separate phrases.''

fery had no (intermediate) phrase accents, but:
``In contrast, GToBI assumes that an intermediate phrase boundary is tonally specified
through a phrase accent (Benzm{\"u}ller & Grice, 1998). This claim is based on experiments
evaluating the low trailing tone in falling accents with respect to its alignment properties.
The authors manipulated the amount of stressed and unstressed syllables after the nuclear
accent, and observed that the alignment position of the low trailing tone is independent of the
pitch accent but instead correlates with the location of the next stressed syllable, and take this
observation as evidence for the presence of the trailing tone as independent phrase accent.''


Beach
(1991) examined to what degree duration and f0 contributed to ambiguity resolution.

p. 84
``The most important finding derived from Experiment 4 is that the exchange of prefinal lengthening
on the first NP did not affect the disambiguation substantially. In fact, the performed durational manipulation
on the original and non-original conditions led to the same response pattern as was the case
for the unmanipulated sentence conditions presented in Experiment 1 above. Therefore, the result of
Experiment 4 can be taken as a further piece of evidence that the information of the boundary tone at
the position of NP1 seems to be a relevant prosodic correlate. In contrast, the information of the prefinal
lengthening had no effect on listeners' disambiguation ability.''

---> relative boundary strength not clear after frist NP? 


gollrad on pauses (in phi-phase perception):
``
The finding that word duration appears to be a more crucial cue for disambiguation than pause duration,
reinforces Goldman-Eisler's observation. She found that in English a pause is often used to signal
cognitive activity rather than a syntactic boundary (Goldman-Eisler, 1972). Therefore, as a correlate of
syntactic boundaries, pause duration appears to be less reliable than word duration. Another possible
explanation for the word duration to be a decisive prosodic cue rather than pause duration is discussed
in Schmitz (2009) who revealed that it is not the physical presence of a pause in the speech signal that
triggers the perception of phrases and clauses. Rather, pauses seem to have a more complementary status:
if other cues indicate a prosodic boundary, a pause is assumed to be present as well. Schmitz' study
provided further evidence that the pause does not seem to be a necessary cue to identify j- and i-phrase
boundaries in the speech stream, and argued that syntactic and/or prosodic units are often but not always
demarcated by a pause. Furthermore, pauses may occur in other positions in the speech stream
and also have different functions.''

for phi-phraseses, intonation not so important: 
``j-phrase boundary may be obscured or enhanced by the prosodic informativeness
of the prosodic cue prefinal lengthening and implies a diminished or rather lacking tonal influence for its
identification in perception. This observation speaks in favor of models in which j-phrases are composed
of pitch accents which are not obligatory followed by a phrasal boundary tone, implicating no need for
an intermediate phrase boundary tone, as was already suggested by F{\'e}ry (1993).''},

b. vs. c. because the 'just' in b. is 'stressless'. but that can't be right:

Not clear that a COUNTERpresupposiition is necessary.


Presupposition encoded acc to Rel. Givenness: There was a statement about books.

Terminology: Halliday 1967.
[+focus] = new
[-focus] = old

Experiment showing that the prominence on a predicate contains no informatio about the ``given-new'' status of that predicate if it is followed by a lexical object that carries sentence stress. 

Conclusion: 
(a) prosodic structure is not (fully)predictable from syntactic structure (status of lexical object is not a syntactic concept)
(b) relation between "new"ness and a setence accent is indirect (since predicate may lack accents even when  new)

The Model:

SAAR (Sentence Accent Assignment Rule (cf. Gussenhoven 1984-Book)

P (predicate), A (argument), C (condition= adjunct), X (any constituent)

(Capitals indicate focus)

Domain assignment: 	P(x)A -> |P(x)A|
		A(x)P -> |A(x)P|
		X -> |X|
Accent assignment	|   | -> * (in AP/PA, * goes to A)

(further restrictions on type of A that allow integration with predicate...
the prisoners escaped vs. everyone has escaped)

"independent quantifiers" cannot cannot merge with Ps

The Consequences:

(1) PA with accent on A: ambiguous between P [+focus] and P [-focus]
(2) PC not ambiguous:  accent when [+focus], no accent when [-focus]


Other literature (capitatlization indicates presence of accent,
no experimental tests):
----------------
Pro (1):

Palmer 1974: 223-3.

This students wants to drop lingUISts. 

ambiguous between those two readings:
this student wants to give lingUIstics up, and
this student wants to give linguistics UP.

Chafe 1970: The student emptied the BOX.

Chomsky 1971: He said we should look out for an ex-convict with a red shirt.

Bing (1979)

----------------------------
Contra (1):

Halliday (1967: 208) claims: 'they teach classics' distinct in the two cases where predicate is part of question or is not, contra (1).

Enkvist 1979: 
Did Charlie kick the BUCKEt?

without an accent on `kick' only literal reading.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Experiment.

Structure A. (PA)

Constexts:
	[+ focus] do you live by yourself? 
	[-focus] i hate sharing things, don't you?

Answer:  I share a flat.

Structure B (PC)

Contexts:
	[+focus] please tell what happened that night.
	[-focus] what do yo remember from your last lesson?
Answer: I remember nothing.

Test: Dyads (question + answer pair). Crossspliced (exchange answer between focus condition). Can people Tell the difference?

Prediction: A 50\%error, B 50\%-100\% Correct

`Context Retrievability Score' (CRS)

Syllable distance between main syllables in P and X was varied.

Prediction: Distance will improve score for B, not affect score for A.

Control for what a perceivable difference is like:

Structure C (PA)

contexts
	A[+focus] Anything you want me to say to her?
	A[-focus] She seemed sort of sorry there'd never be another coup.

answer	Tell her I'm planning a coup. (PLAN/COUP)

expectation: CRS:  near 100\% discrimation of spliced contexts.


Refined Prediction:

1. A : CRS 50\%. B 50\%-100\%
2. Distance between accents has no effect on CRS in A, but a graded positive effect in B
(1 and 2) tested by dyad comparision test
3. CRS of utterances in B, not in A, correlates positively with the perceived stress on prefinal constituent (tested by stress judgment test

-------

methods: 
- in no contexts was the utterance spoken in the context combined with on the test tape avoid tessitura-matching effects (brown, currie kenworthy 1980, book)
(same key in same utterance)
- same order of presentation of answers in [+focus] and [-focus] contexts
- items with equal distances were presented in different orders...
- clustering of speakers and utterances avoided

--------

Results.

CRS predictions borne out: A ca. 50\%, $<$ B $<$ C (differences significant)

focus projection bei halliday:

"A specific question is derivable from any information unit except
one with unmarked focus ; one with unmarked focus does not imply
any preceding information [ . . . ] Where the focus is unmarked, [ .. . ]
its domain may be the whole of the information unit. An item with
unmarked focus may thus be represented as being ambiguous, as
having the structure either given - new or simply new" (L31 : 208).

and Chomsky, 1971:

""This [ . . . J suggests that when expressive or contrastive stress shifts
intonation center, the same principle applies as in normal cases for
determining focus and presupposition, but with the additional proviso
that naturalness declines far more sharply as larger and larger phrases
containing the intonation center are considered as a possible focus".
(L12: 98f)"

conditions on syntactic markers (fi) based on semantic representation involving Fi:

1 all and only Fi constituent are fn marked or dominated by an fn.
2 only non-empty consituents are marked with fn
3 it is not possible to reduce the number of occurrences of fn in s without 
	violating 1 or 2.

Conditions on Stress placement (SC sister constituents):

distribution of + and i on leaves and branches of trees.

p. 14

(R1) For any syntactic struture S, any set of sister-constituents SC within S and any i (i>=1):
If there is an element of SC that is marked with [fi],o r domintates a constituent marked with [fi] in S, then `+' is assigned to every element c of SC such that

a. c is marked with [fi] or dominates a constituent marked with [fi] in s;
b. there is no j < i such that an element of SC is marked with [fj] or dominates  a constiutent of S with [fj], or a constituent of S marked with [fj] dominates c.


p. 15
"R1 does not tell us how to assign `+' and `-' to sets of sister-constituents not containing any occurrences of the focus feature, i.e. to setts that will have neutral stress."

(R2) For any syntactic structure S, any set of sister-constituents SC within S and any i (i>=1):
if no element of SC is marked with [fi] or domianets a constiutent marked with [fi] in S, then `+' can be assigned to every element of SC that is not marked with [-ns].


[-ns] elements:
dass, man , jemenad, niemand, wer, wen was, wo.

"larger constituents, too, can become [-ns] under certain syntactic or proagmatic conditions. 

- PP -ns if NP daughter is -ns
- NP becomes -ns if its dentoation is contextually present. 

p.16
"What is common to all -ns constituents is that they are informationally irrelevant, either instrinsically or contextually"


integration as another factor:

(R3) For any syntactic structure S, any set of sister-constituents SC within S and any i (i>=1): if element c1 of SC is integrated into another element c2 of SC, then plus can be assigned to c1

condition on integration:

(C2) Within a set of sister-constituents SC, integartion takes place only i f the elements of SC do not function as separate informational units in the communication.


conditions on integration:
- focused material cannot be integratedd
- [-ns] constituents cannot be integrated (e..g pronouns)
-  non-adjacent material cannot be integrated
- topic comment boundaries


Sasse 1987: thetic, categorical distinction.

arguments integrated into heads, but not vice-versa.

(C3) Within a set of sister-constituents SC , element c1 can be integrated into element c2 only if c2 neither is an argument of c1 nor contains arguments of the lexical head of c2.

RElation between prominence trees and metrical grids:

p.27
(C4) A pair <T, G> is well-formed if every set of sister-constituents SC of T is such that 1 and 2 are true:
1. the designated syllables of every `+'-element of SC are stronger in G than all syllables of other elements of SC
2. the desginaged syllables of all `+' element of SC have the same strength in G.

p.28
(NSR) For any grid C corresponding to a full intonational phrase: one further occurrence of * may be added to the last of the highest columns of G.


"This explains the fact that---under certain stylistic conditions, e.g. relatively fast speech---the last syllable of (T17a) will be perceived as carrying the strongest beat even though it will be equal in prominence to the syllable muen- in terms of FBS (focus background structure).

doesn't need rules of focus projection---which seem odd anyway, given that projection usually works differnetly (rochemont1986).

Cristo, 1998; Clech-Darbon, Rebuschi & Rialland, 1997)."

"Though the type of our focus sentences was close to Di Cristo's
objective contrastive focus, we found many examples where the rise occurs
on the final stressed syllable of the focused word."

``The postfocus
sequence in French is therefore deaccented, but not dephrased.''

"Results show that both absolute duration and relative lengthening of
AP-final syllables in neutral sentences are maintained in focus sentences.
The post-focus sequence seems not to be dephrased. Though it loses its
intonational phrasal cues, it maintains its durational phrasal cues. The postfocus
sequence in French is therefore deaccented, but not dephrased."

pattern occurs in English vocatives (Ladd, 1978, 1980, 1996;

"In contrast, progressive final lengthening, which can extend over several syllables and
would seem to require looking ahead to anticipate an upcoming phrasal boundary, is treated
entirely incrementally as a left-to-right process (p. 390). Each word is longer than the one
before, up until a break at the end of an Intonational Phrase."


"However, the L89 model of phrase-level planning has not yet been revisited in the
same way, and the task of integrating the LRM99 model of single word processing with a model
of connected speech processing has been largely left for future work."

Levelt, Roelofs & Meyer (1999)'s important model of planning for speech

As discussed at length in Keating & Shattuck-Hufnagel (2002), the missing ingredient
from their model (and similarly, from the model in Levelt, 1989) is the close link
between prosodic structure and segmental phonetic properties.

See Shattuck-Hufnagel & Turk (1996) and Fougeron (1999)
for reviews of the articulation of prominence and final lengthening, which will not be
discussed in any detail in this chapter.

Phonetics, 24, 209-244.

Routledge.


An important finding about domain-final lengthening is
relevant here. Klatt ~1975! and Wightman et al. ~1992!
showed that final lengthening is found at more than one domain
level, and the lengthening is greater at the end of higher
domains than of lower domains. That is, this edge effect
operates hierarchically. Similarly, Jun ~1993 p. 237! proposed
that ``there is a hierarchy of strength of prosodic position''
to account for her finding that voice onset time
~VOT! of a Korean consonant is greatest when phrase-initial,
next greatest when word-initial but phrase-medial, and least
when word- and phrase-medial.},

early instrumental work on prosody:

p. 11
``Much of thiswork has focused on discovering the
acoustic cues to several specific intonational phenomena, in particular: (a) syntactic/
pragmatic notions like `finality', `continuation', and `interrogation' (e.g.
Hadding-Koch and Studdert-Kennedy 1964; Delattre 1963; Lieberman 1967);
(b) emotional states such as anger, surprise, and boredom (e.g. Lieberman and
Michaels 1962; Williams and Stevens 1972); and (c) word and sentence stress
(e.g. Fry 1958; Lieberman 1960).''

p. 14
IPO theory: prominence-lending vs. non-prominence-lending pitch movements
``Pitch movements used in this way
are called `prominence-lending'. Dutch prominence-lending pitch movements
include both a rise and a fall occurring relatively early in the stressed syllable,
an extremely late rise, and a kind of half-fall. These are distinguished
from certain other pitch movements that are `non-prominence-lending'. Nonprominence-
lending pitch movements include a rise and a fall that occur at
phrase boundaries, plus a rise and a fall that (unlike the other pitch movements
in the model's inventory) may span several syllables.''


p. 16 Declination
``Perhaps the best-known feature of the IPO approach to phonetic realisation
is the notion of declination. This term was coined by Cohen and 't Hart (1967:
184) to describe the downward trend of F0 observable in many utterances,
and has since been adopted by a wide variety of authors. In the IPO model,
declination refers specifically to the trend of the top and bottom lines that
define the limits of the local pitch movements -- the lines notated ∅ and 0 in the
abstract phonological formulas that represent contours.''

p. 20 Pierrehumbert & Liberman criticism of Cooper & Sorensen:
``[Their] procedure would give
a reasonable picture of data that varied continuously, but it would also make
data that fall into two categories with varying probability look as if they varied
continuously''

p. 20
``More or less the same point is made by Arvaniti, Ladd, and Mennen (2006)
in their critique of Xu's purely parametric approach to intonational meaning.''


p. 21 early work on givenness
"Fowler and Housum (1987) and Shields and Balota
(1991) found that `second mentions' of nouns in a discourse were shorter
than `first mentions', while Koopmans-van Beinum and van Bergem (1989)
found spectral and F0 effects of givenness but no durational effects."

``This neglect of pitch accent was called into question by Hawkins and
Warren (1991), who performed the same sort of study as Fowler and Housum
(1987) (i.e. testing the intelligibility of words excised from context). Hawkins
and Warren showed that accentedness, not givenness per se, was the main
source of differences in intelligibility."

Similar point on emotion: ``Scherer and his collaborators (Scherer,
Ladd, and Silverman 1984; Ladd et al. 1985; Ladd, Scherer, and Silverman
1986).'' p. 22 ``For example, yes--no questions with a final fall -- but
not any of the other three combinations -- were judged strongly `challenging'.''


p. 22 Overlay models
``I have elsewhere
called overlay models of F0 (Ladd 1988)''


p. 35
pike on attitude: ``the hearer is frequently more interested in the speaker's attitude than in
his words -- that is, whether a sentence is `spoken with a smile' or with a
sneer . . . If one says something insulting, but smiles in face and voice, the
utterance may be a great compliment; but if one says something very complimentary,
but with an intonation of contempt, the result is an insult. A highly
forceful or exciting statement in a very matter-of-fact intonation may, by its
lack of balance, produce one type of irony. (1945: 22)''


p. 36 German lip rounding
``A clear example of this is
provided by a paralinguistic lip-pursing gesture which is very characteristic of
German speech; it seems to convey something like friendliness or reassurance,
or some other kind of empathy with the hearer. The acoustic effects of this
gesture are, not surprisingly, rather similar to those of phonologically specified
lip rounding, and a phonologically unrounded vowel spoken with paralinguistic
lip pursing may sound more like a rounded vowel than like a typical unrounded
one. This is sometimes represented orthographically in written dialogue by
using the letters for rounded vowels. In German comic books I have observed
both n¨o¨o and m¨o¨o¨onsch as representations of pursed-lips pronunciations of,
respectively, nee (`no', colloquial) and Mensch (`man!', colloquial interjection).
In Kurt Vonnegut's World War II novel Slaughterhouse-Five, German railway
guards are reported as lazily saying `Yo, yo' (presumably Ja, ja `Yes, yes' with
paralinguistic lip pursing) to American prisoners of war who have just reported
that one of their fellows has died in transit."

p. 41 intonational morphemes
"Bolinger and Gussenhoven, for
example, have extensively developed the idea of `intonational morphemes';
much of their work on intonational meaning (especially Gussenhoven 1984;
Bolinger 1986, 1989) consists of detailed explications of specific intonational
nuances on the basis of postulated general meanings for specific elements of
intonational analysis."

p. 54 abstract prominence relations
prominence in the absence of accent 

p. 59 french does not have stress
``Indeed, it has been suggested (e.g. by Beckman 1986: 33) that French
does not have stress at all, but only `demarcative' cues to the edge of a phonological
word or phrase; furthermore, there is psycholinguistic evidence that
French-speakers are generally insensitive to stress in other languages (Dupoux
et al. 1997; Dupoux, Peperkamp, and Sebasti´an Gall´es 2001). Yet it has been
convincingly argued by Dell (1984) that the distribution of tonal properties of
French intonation contours can only be accounted for by assuming that the last
full-vowel syllable in a French phonological word has some special structural
prominence'' Dell: tone alignment with vocatives (p. 60 ladd)


p. 63 isacenko and sch{\"a}dlich
``For example, the idea that intonation involves distinctivemovements between
relatively low pitch and relatively high pitch was developed independently
during the 1960s by both Isaˇcenko and Sch¨adlich (1970) and the IPOresearchers
(see section 1.2)."},

"or course, our argument may be faulted for dealing with examples that are perhaps as close to music as to speech.. our only defense, at this stage, is that the task performed is unisng thse chantes, the association of a given melody with a string of words, is exactly analogous to the task we have defined for intonationall rules...

p. 56 breaking up of a single syllable into two metrical parts: JO-HON.: melisma (in musical parlance) for l., this is an optional trick of scansion


p. 65 Desginated Element in node N (connected by s)

"The designated terminal element of ametrical node N is that terminal element dominated y N which is reached by a path starting from N that intersects no nodes labelled W."


Tone alignment (p. 66):

"[...] when a single tonal element is linked (by superimposition ofmetrical patterns) with a metrical constituent of th text, it is to be attached to the designated terminal element of that constituent"


Metrical association rule covering both melisma and anti-melisma:

p. 68
If two metrical trees T1 and T2 are congruent, and N1 is a metrical node, element T1, which immediately dominates a terminal element x [a triangle], and which corresponds to a metrical node N2 element T@, then x will be associated with thedeisngated terminal elemnt iof N2.


----> can be stated easier by introduction of metrical grid (p. 70)

"The Grid, like time, is in principle infinite -- we can pick any place in it to start, and have available sequences forward and backward, or up and down in the hierarchy, as we choose."



p. 87 skipping and congruence

if the nodes ni and nj correspond, and ni is iambic (i.e. has the form [ws]) wihle nj is trochaic (i.e. has the form [sw]), then Nj corresponds to the right (i.e. strong) daughter of Ni.


(this also accounts for the omission of the first L in the vocative chant)

---> is this related to the rhythm rule at all?

James Burnett (17xx): "a natural propensity in the human mind to apply number and measure to every thing we hear; and indeed to very thing, as it is a necessary operation of intellect, beling that by which intellect creates to itself its proper objects." "And as this propensity of the mind is previous to any opinion ofr determination of the will, I think, you properly call it instinctive. This is undoubtedly the foundation of all rhythm..."

p. 102
liberman/sag contour: L H L (first tone associates at the beginning, H to main stress, in between interpolation).

vocative chant: every pre-main syllable associates with L. 

p.103
difference between chants and other tunes: "every syllable must associate with a tone". 

p.123 pre-head high vs. low: fall afterwards is timed purely by physiology. 

p. 127 says that speech pitch uses octave cut into 4 intervals, whichmakes the minor third interval (between H and M in vocative chant) a natural interval. the tetratonic scale is not used in much.

pike 1945 p. 26 claims there are four pitch levels.

p. 133 compositional morphemic analysis of tonal tunes 

p. 137 the scyllla and charybdis of "artifical complextity" and " oversimplificiation" in decompositional analyses of intonational tunes.

p, 140 intonational meaning encoded in terms of ideophones (similar to -ink, in wink an blink)---non-arbitrary (rising vs. falling, (the latter is closing...))

p. 145 iconicity


p. 187
main clause + tag = stem + affix

crystal in prosodic systems and the intonation of english p. 217--220 establishes conecept of complex or compound nuclear tone. 


p. 194
two arguments for cyclicity in the literature:

- structure dependence of relative stress.
- preservation of relative stress under embedding

property of metrical theory operating only with strong/weak:

you can apply the rules from top down from bottom up---doesn't matter, leads to the same result. 

there is no need for cyclic rule application---the nature of prominence in itself is "cyclic" (meaning recursive).

"the crucial difference between the metrical theory and the conventioinal theory is that the metrical theory deasl with the specification of noeds, while the conventional theory deals with the specification of segments. 

arbitrary exceptoins fo words stress (p.206).

p. 207: Point #1 above is just one of many exampls of how the Lexicaon infects with arbitrariness everything it touches. playing the role of the village idiot savant, it mimics the operations of syntax and semantics in its own peculiear way, which gives rise to complex and semi-productive systems -- it is hardly suprising that its forays into the realm of prosody are likewise oa complex mixture ofpoductive and arbitrary principles.

p. 209 word stress principles.

important: difference between segmental unstressedness and metrical w: modest vs. gynmnast ---> there is no metrical way to distinguish them, since metrical is intrinsically relative [ s w ] . introduces segmental feature +/- stress, which interacts with metrcial structure assignment.

p. 210 

basic constituent structure of english word: [[[[ a ] b ] c ] d ]

foot boundary symbolized by |

well formedness condition: 

| x | x x |  *right branching metrical tree
| x x | x | *left branching metrical tree


p. 212

In any lexical metrical constituent [ M N], N is strong if and only if it is complex.

liberman proposes to collapse it with the compound rule

-----> this is not always true: norwegen...

 
unification of word stress and compound stress also in halle 1973:
stress rules in english---a new version LI 4 4 

p. 238 rhythm rule on a metrical tree 

w s s ---> s w s 

----> at any level in the merical tree!!!

his rhythm rule is relabeling---not rebracketing. rebracketing, however, also exists. see below.

anaphoric reference (shift)
vs. fantastic reference (no shift, since w is missing, only ss at second line)



rhythm rule: 

biblical hebrew: ?oo'keel +  'lehem --> '?ookeel 'lehem
vowel length maintained (prince's dissertation)



p. 244: factors confounding the nsr

1. stress pattern determined by head of construction (avenue/street)
2. modifier-head relationship that is crucial (steel warehouse) (here, the distinction, acc. liberman, is really syntactic: steel can be an adjective. 

maybe an argument in favor: i want a steel one (is it possible)? 
it's not a steel steel warehouse...

liberman: difference by diacritic +/- complex, which affects MSR/CSR


3. "communicative dynamism" (prague school term for information structure)

249
"A phenomenon that might be called emphatic stressing, which relates pragmatically to the idea off degree of communicative importance, but which we regard as arsiing from a special kind of alignment with the metrical grid, rather than from any change in metrical pattern. 

250
...anaphoric destressing creates exception so the nsr 


p, 250 "anaphric material is intrinsically weak" (this is taken up by jacobs and reinhart)


p.250 
"One not unreasonable hypothesis would permit free assignment of either [ws] or [sw] to any phrasal contituent, but would stipulate that the pattern [sw] will have some special pragmatic sjustification."

the alternative is to postulate some set of fetures like [+/- contrastive], assigned to nodes, which influence prosodic and tonal phenomena in some way.
"The main difficulty in this area is that nobody has ever gotten the facts straight, to my knowledge."


p. 251 four potentially different factors, maybe incorrectly lumped together:

1. stress differnences,
2. tune differences
3. register differences
4. rhythmic differences

p. 252
"I will simply observe, at this point, that a contrasted constituent will always be metrically strong, if it can be."

(exconvict with a read shirt---> simply all the strong nodes can be focus, no additional stipulcation necessary.


p. 257 rebracketing ([ over everyone's] protests 256



p. 258
"Thus the most basic assumptions of our theory depend on the idea that the phonological component is not so much a destruction of structure, which maps a complex tree onto a simple serial ordering of segements, as a trasnmutation of structure, which maps a structure suitable for operations in one  domain (syntax and semantics) onto a structure suitable for use in another domain, the motor control of articulatory gestures, and its perceptual analogue)."

p. 260 rebracketing explains john's coming.

imopossible in ...as John is

for l. , becsuase is is s in [s w] --- he crucially needs somthing unrponounced be follow, or at least he needs a complex metrical node. 


p. 269--271 notation of recitativos (his example is schuetz's bring dem herren) without bar codes in musical notation---"it was intended to be patterned in a way wchih was believed to be implicit in the text". 

"the metrical grid is an intuited structuring of time"


p. 280
metrical grids are not trees-- we have seen no reason to supopose that they define any particular constituent structure, and there is also no real erason to believe that they are "rooted", that is, that  in every case thehighest level in the hierarchy consists of a single element."

p.280
metrical grid as an ordered set of ordered sets, and a function F with the property thtat it maps every member of Lm+1 onto some member of LM in a way which preserves order. 

for all li, lj: if li > lj, then F(li) > F(lj)


p.282/280
no constituent structure: like in idsardi 1992


p.284 
in his grid convention, no two non-projecting elements are possible---in apparent cases of this type, there is an additional beat---but one that doesnt allign to any segment. it alligsn toa zero:


p.285
"While i am not in a position to carry this idea much past the speculative stage at the moment, such phenomnena suggest to me the diea that the "boudnaries" whohse existencance we have postulaed on tonal grounds, in fact have phonetic content even in the textual string, namely the phonetic content of zero. like zero in arithmetic, they wold serve as placeholders oin a sring, taking up phonetic space without adding any features of their own, other than the effect that they have on the realization ~(and meaning) of the string in which they occur. The well-known phenomenon of pre-pausal lengthening, in Englishk might be laid in aprt to their account."


other evidene: pausal forms in biblical hebrew

john struck out my friend (with more prominence of struck than the particle) only possible if subject is long

p.300

"I am not sure how to represent this pattern/grid interaction theoretically. there are various possibilities; from the standpount of our present discussion, the answer doesn't matter." (pattern and grid underlined)


p. 301ff summation

metrical patterns --- impose metricla structure on xomplex events
metrical grids --- which imposes metrical structure on the dimension of time

no more than two elemnts of the image et, and and not more than tow members of the complement of its image set, can be adjacent. 

p. 302
the effect of a grid is to define a multidimensional structure on the unidimensional flow of time.

bresnan debate:


p.309
"i do not find her arguments especially compelling, although her proposal seems preferable to the alternatives that have been advanced against it by lakoff, berman and szamosi, and bolinger.
the main issue here seems to me to be that whateever is true, must be true universally."


p. 311
in one of his letters epistola CI) st. augustine wrote that[ ..]  "the role that meter plays in all movemnts, is seen more readily in speech." (term used is numberus, as in counting time...)

p.312

liberman links it more generally to temporally structured behavior. 

p. 313
"The metrical organization hypothesis: All temporally ordered behavior is metrically organized."

...
last sentence:
"it would be nice to discover that there is at least that much connection between talk and action."

The types of construction with middle stress are few, but they represent
prolific types. One such construction is exemplified by such phrases as bread to
eat, a favor to ask, instructions to give. Here the middle stress indicates a syntactic
relation in which the noun is the logical object of the verb: that is, bread to
eat has a relationship with 'to eat bread.' Other constructions composed of
noun + to + verb occur without a middle stress, but in  these constructions a
different syntactic relation obtains between the noun and the verb: thus, in
a desire to eat or the will to live, the verb stands in the relation of complement to
the noun, an appropriate paraphrase being 'a desire, namely to eat' and 'the
will, namely to live'; there is no idea of 'to eat a desire' (as 'to eat bread') or 'to
live the will.' The distinction between these two types of syntactic relation
will emerge more sharply from the following contrasts:
I have instrUctions to leave ('I am to leave instructions')
I have instrUctions to lrove ('I have been instructed to leave')},

Two roles for pitch:

p. 18
"The context sensitive,
tone mapping rules carry the major burden of making a two-tone description
of English intonation possible; without them, it is doubtful that a" des~
cription with any reasonably small number of levels could succeed.
I Second. the system pennits a new choice for expressive use of pitch range
at each new pitch accent. The choice is made on the basis of the stress
subordination in the phrase and the speaker's desire to highlight particular
information. Sections 3 and 4 elaborate this idea. In contexts
where both the first and the second of these influences on pitch range
are applicable, the two seem to interact multiplicatively in determining
the F0 value of a given tone."

"8) This is the cat \% that ate the rat \% that stole the cheese . . .
In some of these cases, the intonation phrases are syntactic constituents
provided that we countenance string vacuous applications of independently
motivated syntactic readjustments. 8), for example, could arise from
extraposition of the relative clause by the same rule which applies in 9)
to extrapose the relative clause from its underlying position in the
subject noun phrase to the end of the sentence."

lexical entries for tones:
"Lastly, we see from the coexistence of H*+L'"
and L*+H- with H-+L* and l"+H* that the metrical structure for pitch
accents 1s not predictable. Instead, the bitonal accents with their
associated structure appear to be lexical items in the intonationa1system~"

page 28
"The phrase accent and the boundary tone are each a single tone;
neither can be bitonal like a p~tch accent."

page 28
"Observations made by Traget' and Smith
"(1951), Ladd (1978), and Carlson (MS) suggest that a meaning for the
boundary tone can be identified, and so there is no reason to view the
combination of phrase accent and boundary tone as a lexical unit. We
will also see that all possible combinations of nuclear pitch accent,
phrase accent, and boundary tone correspond to well-formed F0 contours
in English."

page 30 
"Our impression is that the meaning of the
contours is -in gen~ral compOSitional from the pitch accents, phrase
accent, and boundary tone; the tunes in Libenman's lexicon may then be
characterized as intonational idiom chunks."

page 31/32: No Distinction between pitch accent-aspects and phrasal aspects of intonation

"In the brief discussion of phrasal intonation in Bolinger
(1958), it is presented as a problem which is separate from the problem
of describing the pitch accents, and which is still unsolved. A description
in which the phrasal intonation appears in the overall direction
of the pitch accents is suggested. In our theory, there ·is no separate
layer of phrasal intonation. It appears that some melodic contrasts
·which Bolinger would attribute to differences in phrasal intonation are
generated by the phrase accent and boundary tone in our theory."

p. 33
"The metrical grid is a device for interpreting the
metrical tree, which was introduced above for describing word stress.
Here, we will be interested in the use of these representations to
describe phrasal stress subordination."

page 36
the metrical tree underdeterimines the prominence relation between certain elements---this were optionality comes in!

page 50
Downstep:
"We will assume
that the series of phonetic values of the tonal sequence is initialized
by the speaker's choice of value for the first H tone, for expressive
purposes. Given that the value of a downstepped H is lowered by a factor
of k relative to the preceding H, a chain of downstepped His then results
in a sequence of phonetic values of the formk/H 2 n 1/ k IH1/ * ** 'k IH1/."

page 58
"Specifically, we propose a downstep rule which'
lowers the location of H after a H+L pitch accent. When this,ru1e applies
iteratively to a series of H+L accents, it creates the configuration
shown in Fi,9ure 21. Such rules are well known from African tone
languages, where an underlying analysis with level tones is well-motivated
and generally agreed on."

page 63
intonation pragmatic, not semantic: does not encode the same things that syntax/morphology encodes.

"The intonation solicits a response, but the response sought is not
infonmation about whether the sentence is true or not, but rather of a
much more general character. In contrast, when subject auxiliary inversion
is used to mark a question, exactly the truth value is in question.
As a result, the grammaticalized relative of 45) would seem very bizarre
1n the same circumstances:
46) Is my name l~ark Liberman?
A similar example was overheard while leaving a movie theatre:
47) I thought it was good
I
H* H- H\%"

page 66
"On the other hand, some theories, such as Bolinger (.1958)
and Thorsen (1980), take the melodic correlate of phrasing to be the
overall shape of the contour, on which the pitch accents ride. Our
theory does not have two different layers of specification which add up
in this' fashion; the underlying representation of intonation is a wellordered
sequence of tones, and the tones which are associated with the
phrase as a whole rather than with particular pitch accents are confined
to the end of the phrase."

page 69/70: Difference between H* and L*

"We can identify three surface differences between H* and L*.
First, there is a paradigmatic distinction in level: in all of the
figures just mentioned, L* is lower than H* in the same context.
Second, as we mentioned in Chapter 1, the phonetic value ofL~:
decreases if its prominence is increased. [{\ldots}]. 

The third difference between L* andH* is that they are
treated differently by the interpolation rules. Between two H*s, one
finds the dipping -shown in Figures 10 and 11. The interpolation between
L* and any other tone (either L or H) is monotonic.
"

page 75
"The difference between L* and H* under changes in prominence
does not generalize to Land H.H tones all go up under increases
in prominence, but not all LIS go downi in some cases. HIS drag L tones
upward with them. Specifically. a L tone in a bitonal accent goes up
as a ratio of the value of the H. This point is illustrated in Figure
21. We will see 1n Chapter 3 that the L - phrase accent after H* also
. goes up as increasing prominence raises the H*."

page 91
contour of yes/no questions:
"That is. we are not led
to suggest that questions have an overall rising and expanding pitch
range. as Bing (1979) does. Figure 38 shows a comparison between a
longish declarative sentence and the same sentence ending in a question
rise. The overall shape of the question is slightly downdrifting,just
like the sta,tement. It is only the phrase final sequence H- H\% (which
is compressed onto a single syllable) that generates an F0 value standing
out above the generally falling pattern."

page 95
tags/vocatives:
"An interesting problem which is discussed in Liberman (1975)
. and Bing (1979) 1s how to describe the intonational contrast found
between sentences like 5) and 6).
5) Sam struck out my friend.
6) Sam struck out, ~ friend.
One rendition of the contrast is shown in Figures 41 and 42. In Figure
41. an F" contour for 5), "friend" has nuclear stress 1n the phrase.
In 42. an FrI contour for 6), lIoutll has a nuclear a~cent and the F9J falls
to its 10\"Jest level by the end of "out. II As Bing points out, intonation
patterns like 6 occur not only on vocatives, but also on other tag
expressions, including polite expressions, expletives. epithets, tag
questions. quotative and epistemic verbs. and sentence adverbials."

p. 96
"One of 81ng's observations about these expressions is that they lack F0
marking of prominencei in our terms, they do not carry pitch accents."

page 97 
"Our hypothesis is that the intonation of tag expressions is
to be accounted' for by one of two expansions of the. grammar of tonal
98
sequences for the intonation phrase given in Chapter 1. Either the tag
expression carries a second phrase accent, which follows the first phrase
accent before the boundary tone, or else the tag carries both a second I
phrase accent and a second boundary tone."

page 103
"In the wake of Fry's classic study (Fry, 1958), the impression
grew up that F0 can be viewed as a transducer of stress: the higher
the stress, the higher the F0 (or the greater the F0 movement)."

"Morton and Jassem (1965) report that either lowering
or raising theF0 locally can produce the impression that a syllable
is stressed."

p. 104
"Nakatani and Aston (1978) report that FfJ was not a cue for stress on a noun following
a focused adjective."

page 105/6
"Wales and Toner (1979) studied what kinds of ambiguous
sentences may be disambiguated using intonation." 

"The only successful disambiguations in their study involved sentences
1fke 28) with the two possible surface structure bracketings. Homonyms
as in 26) could not.-be disambiguated using intonation, nor could deep
structure ambiguities which did not have a correlate in surface structure
bracketing."

page 106
"Experiments by Streeter (1978) confirm that the tonal
correlates of the intonaUona1 phrase boundary are effective perceptual
cues. She studied disambiguation of the phrase, "Aplus E times 0,"
and found that subjects were able to use F~ in determining whether the
speaker's intention ·,.,as "(A plus E) times 0" or I'A plus (E times 0).""

page 118
experiment on declination vs. prominence:
"1) What about Manny? Who came with him?
---- At nna _
H* L L\%
came with Manny.
H* L- H\%
Figure 2 shows the answer in the following dialogue:
2) What about Anna? Who did she come with?
---- Anna came with Manny.
~* L- HI ~* L- LI"

"With only a small amount of practice, even the naive subjects were
able to vary emphasis and intonation pattern orthogonally as the experiment
required."


page 151
"A second approach, proposed in
Clements (1980) and Huang (1979), generates downstep from a hierarchical
representation similar to the metrical trees discussed in
Chapter 2. Our reasons for selecting iterative rule application over
the hierarchical representation are discussed in S~ction 9. However,
we share with Clements and Huang the view that tonal values are
detenmined relationally."

page 242
"An approach in which pitch accents are superimpos~,~.:on a,.",
phrasal intonation contour was also discussed. We suggested that
the facts of Danish intonation, which make the strongest case we know
of for 'such an approach, can also be accounted for in our framework
using a downstep rule. We believe that the facts of English support
a case against such an approach. Consider, for example, Figures
8 and 9. which exhibit downstep in only part of the phrasal contour.
Such examples have a straightforward characterization in a theory
in which downstep is ·a local rule applying to particular tonal
configurations. Difficulties arise. however,if downstep is
attributed instead to a separate layer of phrasal intonation."
{\ldots}
"The basic problem, as we pointed out in Chapter 3, is that
recovering two independently varyi ng 1 ayers from an F~ contour is a
mathematic.ally underdetennine·d problem if the variation in eitlier .
is too rich. One reason we pursued the hypothesis that declination
is fixed was to avoid this problem."

of focus in an answer is to signal other propositions which are potential
answers in the context of the question. Or if we wanted to speak in terms
of contrast, we could say that focus in an answer expresses contrast
between the asserted answer and other potential answers.

So the right
thing to do is to insist that the ordinary semantic value of a question be a
subset of the focus semantic value of a corresponding answer. Through the
intermediary of the two kinds of semantic values, this has the effect of
constraining the question-answer relation.

not every accent in Selkirk's system can carry an F: otherwise, many `embedded F-markers' would be on old information. Footnote 2 shows such accented uses of the given word `book'. The final sentence is actually really interesting:  ``all the glory of the world would be buried in oblivion, unless God had provided mortals with the remedy of books.'' shifting prominece to `remedy' or `mortals' would be completely odd, although `books' is given. What kinds of alternatives does deaccenting the object evoke/require?

page 147
Why, actually, does he state entailment at the level of `utterance':

An utterance is given iff it is entailed by prior discourse.

page 148
hyponym:
``on the prior use of a hyponym, as
in Rochemont's (1986, 50) example where animal counts as given based
on a prior use of gorilla.''

actually, Baumann & Grice find that both hyponyms and hypernyms can induce deaccenting.

on 'antecedent':

page 148

"A word should be said about the term `antecedent'. As in the anaphora
literature, so in the literature on givenness and deaccenting, researchers have
found various factors that affect the ability of one expression to count as
an antecedent for another, including recency and frequency of mention
(Allerton 1978, 142--143) as well as grammatical role and position in the
sentence (for recent discussion see Terken and Hirschberg 1994). In this
section, I will not have anything to say about these matters, but we should
amend the definition slightly to take account of them:
(18) An utterance U is GIVEN iff it has a salient antecedent A and A
entails U, modulo $-type shifting."


focus variables:

page 149
"The notion of entailment doesn't
straightforwardly apply to expressions containing a free variable, so we will
assume an existential quantifier binding these `F-variables' (Williams 1980,
8)."


contextual restriction, page 151: 
Before formalizing the intuitions developed so far, three additional points
about the definition of GIVEN need to be made. The definition makes use
of two existential quantifications. The first is a type shifter and the second
binds F-variables. Only the latter is to be understood as a ``real'' natural
language quantifier in the sense that it is restricted to a contextually relevant
domain.

__> contextual domain restriciton of F-closure, but not fleshed out further...


page 151 
covert vs. accommodated antecedents (SChwa doesn't use word `accommodate' though):

``Also, in the examples discussed
here the relevant antecedent will be overt, but this does not preclude
the possibility that a speaker could insinuate an antecedent, provided the
hearer can accommodate it. To paraphrase Halliday (1967, 204), the rules
governing F-marking depend on what the speaker presents as GIVEN.''


page 153

presups (the presuppositional skeleton) is used differently from rooth: ``In (28), on the other
hand, presups are not used to define sets; instead they define propositions.''



page 154
negative quantifiers and universal quantifiers should be always given:

``We end with an observation about quantificational NPs in this system.
According to (26)--(28), a noun phrase meaning n of type {\'a}{\'a}e, t{\~n}, t{\~n} will count
as GIVEN if it has some salient antecedent which entails $P[n(P)]. Consider
the noun phrase no man. In any world w there will be some property that
is true of no man, even if there are no men. No man will therefore count
as GIVEN in any context. Similarly, in any world, there will be some property
that every man in that world has, even if there are no men. So no man as
well as every man and other strong quantifiers count as GIVEN in any context.''

``It should be noted, however,
that this doesn't translate into the prediction that strong NPs should never
contain F-marking. The NP every man might be GIVEN, but man may not
be, hence it would be F-marked. Furthermore, no man might be GIVEN,
and walks might be GIVEN, but it still could be the case that No man walks
is not GIVEN, requiring F-marking somewhere in the sentence.''


footnote 5: 

F-substitution might be semantically/syntactically restricted: ``The first factor has to do with the possible
values for R. Since R replaces a transitive verb, its range may be limited to transitive verb
meanings. The" reference to `unintended givenness antecedents: ``These factors will be discussed in more detail in section 5, where it will be
argued that the choice of F-marking is such as to rule out unintended GIVENness antecedents."


page 165 
``The GIVEN relation is a species of anaphora.''

focus
placement of pitch accents is sentral:
p. 200 
'Our empirical claim is that in English, it is the pitch accent assignment of a sentence that is directly related to its focus properties.'

p. 201
"The first, the BAsic Focus Rule, says siply that a constituent to which a pitch acccent is assigned is focused. For reasons to be explained, the effect of this rule is to say, roughly speakig, that a word is focused if it has a pitch accent. The second rule, the Phrasal Focus Rule, involves a recursive definition of focus. It says thata constituent may be focused if its {\em head} constiuent (usually a Word) is focused and/or if a  constituent contained iwthin it that is an {\em argument} of its head is focused (which is to say, for example, that a VP may be focused if either a verb, or its arhument(s) , or both afre focused).

Lindblom concludes that the increased duration of final syllables compensates
for the lower intensity per unit of time.

Lindblom concludes that the increased duration of final syllables compensates
for the lower intensity per unit of time. However, OlIer and Smith
[1977], who approached the issue from a developmental perspective by
studying the linguistic production of infants, concluded that final-syllable
lengthening constitutes a leamed behavior, since infant speech does Dot display
such a tendency

the greater the lengthening,
the more important the syntactic break (see the experiment by O'Malley et
al. [1973

The lengthening of a single syUabJe is commonJy used to mark
emphasis and contrastive stress (Coker and Umeda, 1973];

deceJeration in
speaking rate is a strategy that may be used by some speakers to emphasize a
word, an entire sentence or a clause [KJoker, 1975

The interrelation between intensity
and fundamental frequency bas a physiological basis. Intensity and fundamental
frequency are reguiated by the same mechanisms (increase in pulmonary
effort and in subglottal pressure, tension of the vocal folds, etc.),
and, as may be expected, higher fundamental frequency is generally correlated
with an increase in intensity (see an illustration of this tendency in
Fig. 5.2). Similarly, the Fo decrease at the end of sentences is matched by an
intensity decrease. Higher intensity of a syllable is also olten correlated with
longer duration. An increase in global articulatory effort to produce perceptuai
prominenoe via intensity may also require additional time, and conse~
quently may result in a lengtheoing of the underlying phoneme. For example,
emphasis is olten marked by bath an increase in intensity and a lengthening
of the underlying segments.
Generally speaking, higher Fo, higher intensity and longer duration naturally
tend to characterize the same segments in a sentence.


It is possible that the specific interrelations betWeen the three suprasegmental
features (Fo, dotation and intensity), and the relation between segmentai
and suprasegmental aspects, rather than each feature taken individually,
are the most salient characteristics differentiating between languages,
dialects, and individual ways of speaking.},

p. 56

Gussenhoven's model includes
an optional rule which allows the unrestricted assignment of pitch accents to the left
of the focal pitch accent within a focus domain, so his theory predicts that the answer
should be appropriate.


p. 56
hat pattern or two nuclear accents in narrow focus condition with object focused? 


p. 57
The
nuclear accent or nuclear accents are claimed to have special prominence, and experimental
evidence for this special status has been found (Ayers, 1996).

p. 58
Using materials structured similarly to those used by Gussenhoven (1983), but
with one condition with a pitch accent on the verb as well as the object NP, Birch and
Clifton (1995) obtained appropriateness judgment ratings and response times (RTs) to
a ``make sense'' judgment task. Response times (RTs) were faster when a New object NP
was accented than when it was not accented. The experiment showed no difference in
RTs for the VP-focus question when there was a pitch accent on both the object NP and
the verb versus only the object NP.

p. 59
experiment 1:
HYPOTHESIS: Nuclear pitch accents, but not prenuclear accents, mark focus.

p. 65
The two-peak pattern is predicted to be appropriate in responses that call for a double
focus structure where the verb and object NP are separately focused. For example, in
(11), read and Dispatch contrast with write and Times.
(11) Q: How do you keep up with the news?
Do you write for the Times or something?
H* L -- H* L --L\%
A: (No,) I [READ]Focus [the DISPATCH]Focus


p. 66
The appropriateness of
the hat pattern suggests that the presence of a prenuclear pitch accent does not affect
focus structure interpretation. Specifically, the prenuclear H* pitch accent on the verb
does not mark focus and create a double focus interpretation.

p. 66 
Bounded Projection Hypothesis: F-marking cannot project beyond the
prosodic phrase which contains the accented material. (Schafer, 1997)


p. 67
It is
likely that in completing the appropriateness ratings task, listeners attempted to imagine
a larger context in which the given response could be appropriate.

---> gradience of judgements related to how easy a presupoostion can be accomodated

The low ratings for the verb-H * pattern suggest that
it was impossible for listeners to imagine an additional context that would make that
pattern an appropriate response to the given questions.

p. 70
The H* and L + H* pitch accents differ in that the H* is realized with a peak
usually within the stressed syllable while the L + H* has a leading L tone near the bottom
of the speaker's pitch range and an F0 peak usually occurring late within or after the
stressed syllable.


phrasing also different: DO might be extraposed!!!

p. 70
Steedman (1990) also
draws a distinction between the pragmatic functions of the L + H* versus H* pitch
accents, relating them to concepts such as theme/ rheme.


p.71
Studies of intertranscriber consistency in ToBI analysis have also shown
that the H*/ L + H* distinction is one of the distinctions with the most intertranscriber
disagreement (Herman & McGory, 2002; McGory, Herman, & Syrdal, 1999). Ladd
and Schepman (2003) argue that not only the L + H*, but also the H*, has distinct L
and H targets. They suggest collapsing the two categories into one pitch accent (L + H)*.
Bartels and Kingston (1994) provide evidence that height of the F0 peak, rather than
the presence of a L tone may be the most reliable cue to distinguishing noncontrastive
H* from contrastive L + H*.

p.71
experiment 2: just accent l H* on object: hypothesis: cant project to vp

One argument for the inaccessibility of the VP focus reading may follow from
Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg's account of the meaning of the L + H* pitch account
in which the L + H* invokes a scale of alternatives. It may be easier for the listener to
interpret an utterance with a L + H* pitch accent on the object NP as narrowly focusing
the object NP and invoking a scale of other noun-referent alternatives than to interpret
the utterance as focusing the entire VP and invoking other complex events as
alternatives (Mary Beckman, p.c.).

PITCH ACCENT TYPE FOCUS PROJECTION HYPOTHESIS: The L + H* pitch accent
is not as effective as the H* pitch accent in projecting focus.


p. 72 footnote:
Utterances of the type included in the experiments require a pitch-accented subject. These
utterances were of the form subject-NP verb object-NP. It is well known that unaccented
New subject NPs are possible in some types of utterances with intransitive verbs (e.g.,
Kennedy DIED.)



liberman and sag:
It is possible that for some of the
items, listeners may have parsed the object-NP-H* pattern as L* H* L --L\%, with a L*
on the verb. If so, they might have interpreted the pattern as a contour discussed in Sag
and Liberman (1975) as the surprise-redundancy contour.


p. 79
Most experimental work on focus projection has examined focus projection within
the verb phrase (e.g., Birch & Clifton, 1995; Schafer, 1997, and this study), but our
knowledge of the phenomenon would be extended by looking at other structures. For
example, it has been observed that the nonfocused NP subject of a sentence is often pitch
accented and even set off in its own prosodic phrase (e.g., Nakatani, 1997). For example,
in (26), the (a) response, where the Given subject John is pitch accented, seems more natural
than the (b) response, where the Given subject is not pitch accented.
(26) Q: What can you tell me about John?
a. A: Oh, JOHN'S a GREAT GUY.
b. A: Oh, John's a GREAT GUY.
